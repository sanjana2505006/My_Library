## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack JavaScript web application built using React on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend. The application follows a client–server architecture and demonstrates core full-stack development concepts such as authentication, RESTful APIs, file handling, and secure data management.

The project is designed to be lightweight and easy to set up, using a file-based JSON datastore instead of a traditional database, making it ideal for rapid development and learning purposes.
